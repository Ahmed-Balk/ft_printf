This project involves reimplementing the printf() fucntion in C by creating ft_printf().
This task provides an opportunity to explore variadic functions and enhance programming skills.

The goal is to create a library named libftprintf.a, which inculdes the ft_printf() function capable of handling various conversions such as characters, strings, pointers, integres, and more.
The implementation does not require replication the original printf()'s buffer management system.

It's a funny project to improve my skills in C.
